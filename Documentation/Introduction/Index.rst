Introduction
------------

The abundance of information available on large web sites makes it
sometimes hard for visitors to find what they are looking for. A
search engine helps, as well as a good navigation. Contexts can help
improve the navigation by creating links between related pieces of
information.

This extension is designed to help work with contexts, however they
may be defined. The idea is to define contexts using TypoScript so
that they can cover whole branches of a web site. The contexts can
then be fetched using :ref:`expressions <expressions:start>`.

This extension is used in the Tesseract project. Within this framework
contexts can be retrieved inside Data Filters. It can also be used
separately.
